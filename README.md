## Description
SMART is a tool used to analyse the contents and metadata about tweets and display this information on a map. This map aids first responders in locating emergencies and staying updated on current events. There is a ML model that is used to classify the tweets as misinformation or not. This model gets updated as the user gives feedback through either labeling the tweet as misinformation or removing the label. THis allows for the model to be tailored to what the user sees as misinformation.  

## Technologies and Tools

- Python
- FastAPI
- pip and virtual environments for dependency management
- Hashmaps
- Machine learning models
- Web interface for map display

## Goals and Progress Plan 

- [] Understand the code
- [] Run and try the code
- [] Document the code
- [] Add way for there to be multiple users all with their own models
- [] Test that the program works with multiple users
